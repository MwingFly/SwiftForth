As of OSX 10.11 El Capitan, security has become a priority. The Cocoa extensions for this Forth
runs ok with gatekeeper in all settings and doesn't touch any System related stuff. SIP doesn't
concern us here. But the OS keeps nagging in Console.app, allthough it looks like that's all it
does. Still I like to shut it up.

To create your own code sign certificate, follow the guide in:
doc/debugger/Installing GDB on OS X Mavericks - Neil Traft.pdf

Terminal:
man codesign

Codesign coco-sf to avoid "SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22" messages in Console.app

codesign -s "certificate name" /Full/path/to/coco-sf

Just follow the prompts.
