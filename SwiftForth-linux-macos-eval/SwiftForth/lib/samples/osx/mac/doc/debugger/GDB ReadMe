mygdb are my MacsBug like words for GDB

Used as follows:

Adjust path to  mygdb  in  gdbinit
Save as  .gdbinit  (with dot in front) in your user home directory

Next time GDB launches it knows about these extensions
Typing   words  in GDB will give some info

As of Mavericks, gdb is out, lldb is in. You can use the lldb-debug.ldr file for that.
So far no MacsBug like actions are defined.

If you still want to use gdb (and the MacsBug stuff ;-) you'll need to install it.
See the 'BuildingOnDarwin - GDB Wiki.pdf' and 'Installing GDB on OS X Mavericks - Neil Traft.pdf' files.
It appears you have to sudo the codesign process, at least on my system:
sudo codesign -s gdb-cert $(which gdb)
