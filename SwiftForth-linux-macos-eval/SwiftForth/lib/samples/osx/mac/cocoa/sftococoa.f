==================================================================== }

{ --------------------------------------------------------------------
Make current background proces (SwiftForth) a GUI app, at least wrt
the GUI itself. Uses NSApplication ActivationPolicies.

SF>COCOA -- transform sf in to coco-sf, following standard procedure:
allocate autoreleasepool, create shared application and set the NSApp
policy to NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular.
*It becomes an ordinary app with an icon in the Dock and a user interface.
NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular is the default for bundled apps,
unless overridden in the Info.plist.

Prior to SF>COCOA, sf activation policy is NSApplicationActivationPolicyProhibited.
Which is typical for processes running in a shell, like sf.
*It does not appear in the Dock and may not create windows or be activated.
This corresponds to the value of the LSBackgroundOnly key in the applicationâ€™s
Info.plist being 1. This is also the default for unbundled executables
that do not have Info.plists.

* = learned from NSRunningApplication.h

0 CONSTANT NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular
2 CONSTANT NSApplicationActivationPolicyProhibited

Test: redefine SF>COCOA and recomplie
COCOA: @activationPolicy ( -- policy )

VARIABLE SF-POLICY

: SF>COCOA ( -- )
	NSApp @ @activationPolicy SF-POLICY !
   SF>COCOA ;
