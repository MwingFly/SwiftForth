Flat assembler for Linux is used to generate the SwiftForth loader.

Get flat assembler here:

http://flatassembler.net/

Source file sf-loader.asm has all the segments, library imports, and
code to generate sf-loader.img.

The SwiftForth target compiler concatenates the binary kernel image to
the end of sf-loader.img and updates the size fields in the ELF header.

The SwiftForth turnkey compiler does the same with a full image of the
dictionary plus the cross-reference table.

Run make.sh to generate a new sf-loader.img (moved to SwiftForth/bin/linux
directory at the end).  The batch file assumes flat assembler is in your path.

bash make.sh
