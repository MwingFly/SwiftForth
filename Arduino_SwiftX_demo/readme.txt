This directory contains the app note SwiftX-Arduino.pdf, which
discusses the SwiftX-AVR implementation specific to the Arduino Uno
and Diecimila boards and presents a simple application for those
boards.  The subdirectory 'distress' contains the source code for the
sample application.

If you install the SwiftX-AVR evaluation version from the FORTH, Inc.
web site, this same demo is installed in the SwiftX/samples directory.
